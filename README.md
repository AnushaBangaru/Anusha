## Built With

For this project we have used the MEAN stack (Mongo DB, ExpressJS, Angular and NodeJS) in addition to Bootstrap css framework.

* [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Document database – used in the back-end application to store the user data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents.
* [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) - Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js  used for creating robust API quickly and easy.
* [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Front-end web app framework; runs the JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing the application UI to be dynamic.
* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime environment, implements the application back-end in JavaScript.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework used on the Frontend for styling.
