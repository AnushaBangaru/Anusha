# Interactive ASL

Interactive ASL is a web application built with the MEAN stack for learning American Sign Language in a easy and intuitive way. This web application has been developed as a final proyect for the [Lecture Advance Web Technologies](https://www.uni-due.de/soco/teaching/courses/lecture-advwebtech-ss18.php).

## Features and Overview

### Features
The project has been focused on giving the user the best experience and resources for learning American Sign Language, so the main features are: 

* Learning section: Allow the user to learn progressively.
* Practicing section: The user can reinforce the knowledge acquired.
* Testing section: Test and consolidate what has been learned.

There is also an user authentication service, the application is only available for registered users. New user should create a new account, the data is stored safely on the database provided by MongoDB, then user can login and access to the main dashboard with the previous features , charts and advices for monitoring progress.

### Overview

A quick overview of the full project and features is available on the following [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTCzfniKJE8). There is also a teaser image and more screenshots on the screenshot folder.

For trying the app please go to the [live demo on Heroku](https://interactive-asl.herokuapp.com/) or download and deploy it locally following the steps described on the get started and deploy section.

## Built With

For this project we have used the MEAN stack (Mongo DB, ExpressJS, Angular and NodeJS) in addition to Bootstrap css framework.

* [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Document database – used in the back-end application to store the user data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents.
* [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) - Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js  used for creating robust API quickly and easy.
* [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Front-end web app framework; runs the JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing the application UI to be dynamic.
* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime environment, implements the application back-end in JavaScript.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework used on the Frontend for styling.

In addition to these technologies [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) has been used for the icons, as well as [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) for the custom theme of Bootstrap.

* MongoDB 



```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
